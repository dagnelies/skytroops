# Possibilities

1. Always shoot forward, old-school.

Input controls are straightforward, but in my opinion it's a bit boring to always shoot forward.
Moreover, you can't really touch ennemies coming from behind or sides, which is annoying.

2. Motionless in the center, shoot in any direction.

Very limiting, game wise, and feels frustrating to not be able to dodge.

3. Shoot in motion trail.

The perfect example for this is http://www.kongregate.com/games/gamereclaim/death-vs-monstars

It worked very well in that game and requires only the mouse.
Notice however that the game is based on a pattern where ennemies follow the player.
For more classic ennemy waves, it becomes more like dodging and shooting in the void.
Especially on mobile, it is difficult to aim reasonably.

4. Allow both moving and aiming independently

The player is able to move and shoot in any direction, independently.
It offers more freedom and is more challenging.
For desktop, it works great. For mobile, again, it's quite difficult because it's unusual for someone to focus both on device motion and where to touch
Moreover, the finger obstructs the view.

# Conclusion

The conclusion is inconclusive. Personnally, after experiencing the various forms, I still don't know what would be best.
Perhaps yet another alternative system like a gamepad at the bottom. To try out.
