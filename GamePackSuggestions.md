* PNGs based on a common screen resolution (not some strange 345x600)
* Full HD PNGs (it's easy to scale it down as a dev, however scaling it up may be akward. It requires tinkering and exporting from the original vector images)
* The map is very nice ...but it would be even cooler if the five kind of backgrounds would be represented in it.
* The map with ...a single path!
